# Federated_Learning_Basic

This Git Repo has been created to share the projects associated Federated Learning In Computer Vision as well as the Deep Learning Framework Implementations associated with it. 

The following files has the basic implementation of Federated learning and Deep Learning models for future reference. The file description for each file is given below

## FILE DESCRIPTIONS

**--Federated_CNN_CIFAR10--**

Basic Federated Learning model with 30 rounds and 8 clients with 3 epochs per client. The Model used here is Convolutional Neural Network. The model focuses on the CIFAR10 dataset of torchvision

**--Federated_CNN_MNIST--**

Basic Federated Learning model with 30 rounds and 8 clients with 3 epochs per client. The Model used here is Convolutional Neural Network. The model focuses on the CIFAR10 dataset of torchvision

**--Multilayer_Perceptron_model--**

A basic implementation of the Multilayer Percerptron model on the MNIST dataset

**--Sigmoid_Neuron_model--**

A basic implementation of the Sigmoid Neuron model on the MNIST dataset

**--Federated_learning_Experiments--**

This folder uses the Federated_learning_CNN on MNIST and changes its parameters and other variables intialiasation to perceive its impact on the output of the whole model. The pictures are seperately provided in the folder.

### NOTE:- *The files are still not finalised and are still under the process of FINE-TUNING.*
